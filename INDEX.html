      All modern websites and web applications are built using three fundamental
      technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are the languages of the
      web.
    </p>
    <h3>What is <em>HTML</em>?</h3>
    <p>
      HTML stands for <strong>H</strong>yperText <strong>M</strong>arkup
      <strong>L</strong>anguage. It's a markup language that web developers use
      to structure and describe the content of a webpage (not a programming
      language).
    </p>
    <p>
      HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content:
      paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers understand
      HTML and render HTML code as websites.
    </p>
    <p>In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The opening tag</li>
      <li>The closing tag</li>
      <li>The actual element</li>
    </ol>
